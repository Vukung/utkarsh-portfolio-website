# Profile Images Setup

## Missing Images

Your portfolio needs two profile images in the `public` folder:

1. **profile.jpg** - Your normal profile photo
2. **profile-glasses.jpg** - Your profile photo wearing glasses (for the Easter egg effect)

## How to Add Your Images

1. **Take or choose your photos:**
   - Get a professional-looking headshot photo of yourself
   - Create a second version with glasses (or any fun variation you want for the Easter egg)

2. **Add them to the project:**
   ```
   Copy your images to:
   c:\Users\Utkarsh\Documents\PROJECTS\Utkarsh Shirbhate Portfolio Website\utkarsh-portfolio\public\
   
   Name them exactly:
   - profile.jpg
   - profile-glasses.jpg
   ```

3. **Temporary Placeholders:**
   I've generated placeholder images for you. You can find them here:
   - C:/Users/Utkarsh/.gemini/antigravity/brain/22e79126-b0ef-4a5b-81d7-72595e3323eb/profile_photo_placeholder_1768201746933.png
   - C:/Users/Utkarsh/.gemini/antigravity/brain/22e79126-b0ef-4a5b-81d7-72595e3323eb/profile_glasses_placeholder_1768201768276.png

   **Manually copy them:**
   - Copy the first file as `profile.jpg` to the public folder
   - Copy the second file as `profile-glasses.jpg` to the public folder

4. **Refresh the page** - The images should now appear!
